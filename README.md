> Curated list of open source tools and projects to help with retrieval augmented generation

RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation, a technique where the capabilities of a large language model (LLM) are augmented by retrieving information from other computer systems and providing them as context for the LLM through the prompt. This gives LLMs information beyond what was provided in their training data, which is critical for LLM applications to provide personalized responses. Example use cases include scraping data from current web pages, parsing data from PDFs and documents, and answering questions about data from Confluence, Salesforce or other SaaS apps.

RAG works better than fine-tuning models because itâ€™s cheaper, itâ€™s faster, and itâ€™s more reliable since metadata about the sources of information is attached to each response.

## We also have an open source project that makes setting up RAG on your own infrastructure super easy. **[Check it out here](https://github.com/psychic-api/rag-stack)**
